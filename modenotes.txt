There are four bitplanes access to which is controlled by $201000

The low bits specify which bitplanes are active in a command (clear=active)
The high bits specify the value written to the bitplane (clear=1)

bit 0: Data
bit 1: Overlay-Data (X)
bit 2: Overlay
bit 3: Attr

Screen output lookup table:

AOXD
1111: 0 (black)
1110: 0
1101: 1
1100: 1
1011: 0
1010: 0
1001: 0
1000: 1
0111: 1
0110: 1
0101: 0
0100: 0
0011: 0.5 (gray)
0010: 0.5 (gray)
0001: 1
0000: 0

If Overlay=0 and OData=0, output is Data xor Attr (1=white, 0=black)
If Overlay=1, output is OData xor Attr 
If Overlay=0 and OData=1, output is 0

If exactly one plane is active, that's the plane that is read from.

Function:
 If AOXD=001x (where x is anything): gray
 Otherwise, black or white according to:
	(Attr^(OV&OData | ~OV&Data)) & ~(OData&~OV)

The display function is implemented in the screenshot code if you
want to see an example.
